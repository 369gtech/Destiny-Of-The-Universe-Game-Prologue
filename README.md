Welcome To Destiny Of The Universe Prologue, here we look at the history of the Universe in Alpha Version before we head to the future where battle lines are created, alliances are formed and we start to expand the game into the 12 Constellations of the Zodiac and beyond.

Alpha Version (History)

4 Billion years ago the Galactic Alliance consisted of 12 different races which included Humans. 
Human Civilization originated from a planetary constellation called Lira. Lira was at the centre of the universe. It championed the Galactic Alliance and helped keep the peace with the power and wisdom of the ancient star knowledge which was given to them by the first ones (hypertel). Lira had a Champion council primarily made up of 12 Elites with a leader called Ka’ree. Each Elite has a unique ability and were the leaders of their clan, they include;

<ul>    
  <li>Ka'ree of the Eclipse Alliance (Leader of the Hypertel Clan, The Elites and The Galactic Alliance)</li>

To keep the peace every galactic precession the 12 major factions of the universe would come together for the Alliance Tournament in the Super Hyperspace Arena to meet and compete for the Star Trophy. The Star Trophy gives the winning race the leadership of the universe. The importance of the games would allow races to show their skill sets and attributes that made that species great in friendly competition with the goal of strengthening ties among the races. 

This led to a great renaissance where the universe flourished and enjoyed a great period of growth and prosperity. Little had everyone known that there was a stirring among the more darker parts of the Galactic Alliance. The Drako, the leader of this shadowy group, grew resentful of the other races because they never won the Star Trophy and were never seen as a major player in the Galactic Alliance due to always finishing last in the Alliance Tournaments. 
They are a race that wants power and will do anything to grab it as that is how they became the leader of the shadowy group. They also delve in  genetic technology and were known to be a very resourceful race.

As it seems the stars would align for The Drako as during a meeting with the Earth Alliance, they overheard Nikro of the Elites talking about his disgruntlement with the leadership of Ka’ree and wanted to be the leader himself. The Drako took no time in assembling a secret meeting with Mikro to discuss a plan to make him the leader of the Human Race but in return The Drako wanted to know all their weaknesses, even Ka’ree’s. Mikro agreed to the Drako terms so at the next Galactic Alliance Tournament they plotted to take our Ka’ree and wipe the other Elites. 

Finally the day had come for the Galactic Alliance Tournament in the Super Hyperspace Arena and unbeknown to everyone what the Drako, Mikro and the shadowy group were about to do with their allies in the Galactic Council - War had struck swiftly and chaos sprung and as agreed the Drako took out Karee and the Elite Council with the knowledge of their weaknesses from Mikro but they didn’t stop there they then used their mind manipulation abilities to turn the humans on themselves and nearly wiped them all out. Mikro yelled out “What are you doing”? But it was too late as he quickly realized that all his friends were dying around him. Once the Humans were nearly wiped out, the Drako and their allies focused their attention on the other Galactic Member States and many of the other races were nearly wiped out instantly too.

But some humans escaped to the far reaches of the universe and one of those places was a planet called Earth. An eon would pass and these stories would be told and before long they would become myths and legends. The humans would almost forget who they once were but they would go onto colonize this planetary system. They would form into 3 major alliances consisting of Sun, Eclipse and Moon - Mercury, Venus and Earth would be know as the Sun Alliance, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn would be know as the Eclipse Alliance and Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be the Moon Alliance. It wouldn't be long before war broke out among the Alliances as they would fight over land, resources and betrayal. This is the start of the monoGames Metaverse journey...

The story line is subject to change, Elite clan leaders will be promo reward nft's and maybe included in the game. The races that are in the Sun, Eclipse and Moon Alliances will eventually be split and have the opportunity to go to one of the 12 constellations to build out their universe subject to the story line. There are plenty of story lines especially when we get into timeline wars which will be part of the reward missions to complete so you can earn in-game currency and nft's depending on the mission you need to complete in Beta and Expansion Versions.
