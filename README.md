<h1>Destiny Of The Universe Game Prologue</h1>

Welcome To Destiny Of The Universe Prologue, here we look at the history of the Universe in Alpha Version before we head to the future where battle lines are created, alliances are formed and we start to expand the game into the 12 Constellations Of The Universe and beyond.

<h3>Alpha Version (History)</h3>

It's a well known fact that the Galactic Alliance consists of 12 different races known as the 12 Major Constellation Factions Of The Universe which are split into 3 Elite Factions known as The Sun, The Moon and The Eclipse. Within each Elite Faction there are 4 Factions with a Leader, a Shadow, a Left Hand and a Right Hand. Each of the 4 Factions have 12 Clans split into tri-factions known as The Light, The Dark and The Grey now the Human civilization originated from the planetary Galaxy called Lira. Lira is at the center of the universe and is a part of The Sun faction called Signum.

To keep the peace every Galactic Precession the 12 Major Constellation Factions Of The Universe would come together for the Alliance Tournament in the Super Hyperspace Arena to meet and compete for the Star Trophy. The Star Trophy gives the winning race the Leadership Of The Universe. The importance of the games would allow Factions to show their skill sets and attributes that made that species great in friendly competition with the goal of strengthening ties among the races. The last game was won by Signum the human civilization led by the leader of The Sun and Head of the Light clan Queen Supreme Kareena Ka’ree.

The games led to a great renaissance where the Universe flourished and enjoyed a great period of growth and prosperity. Little had everyone known that there was a stirring among the more darker parts of the Galactic Alliance. The Drako, The leader of The Moon and Head of Etherium grew resentful of the other races because they never won the Star Trophy and were never seen as a major player in the Galactic Alliance due to always finishing last in the Alliance Tournaments. They are a race that wants power and will do anything to grab it as that is how they became the leader of the shadowy group. They also delve in Genetic Technology and were known to be a very resourceful race.

It seems the stars would align for The Drako Leader Lord Drakonis as he overheard the Head of Burstonia and twin brother to Queen Ka’ree, Lord Burston talking about his disgruntlement of not being the Head of the family and not having the throne wanting it for himself. Lord Drakonis took no time in assembling a plan to get Burstonia and all his allies to fall under his ruling. His plan was to give Lord Burstonia what he wanted and make him the leader of the Signum but in return Lord Drakonis wanted to know all the weaknesses of Signum and their allies so Lord Drakonis could strike them behind their back and make them submit to his ruling. Burstonia quickly agreed to the terms so at the next Galactic Alliance Tournament they plotted to take out Signum and wipe the other Elites not allied with them.

The day finally came for the plans to be set in motion, everyone consistent of most of the Dark alliances throughout the 12 Major Constellation Factions Of The Universe with Drako as their leader calling themselves The Dark Legions were told to be ready.

Draco gives the order to Attack and The Dark Legions ambush with a decisive blow, chaos envelops among the 12 Major Constellations Faction Of The Universe and as The Dark Legions took out Signum first then the majority of the Elite Factions that are not aligned with the Dark Legions but unbeknown to Burstonia and his people that Lord Drakonis and his people didn’t stop there, they then used their mind manipulation abilities to turn on the humans on themselves and nearly wiped most of them out. Burstonia yelled out “What are you doing”? But it was too late as he quickly realized that most of his friends, family and alliance were dying around him; he fled with heavy thoughts and vowed vengeance on The Dark Legions.

But some humans escaped to the far reaches of the Universe and one of those places was a planet called Earthonia. An eon would pass and these stories would be told and before long they would become myths and legends. The humans would almost forget who they once were but they would go onto colonize this planetary system. It wouldn't be long before war broke out among themselves as they would fight over land, resources and betrayal but a bigger war was coming where a truce would need to be implemented to survive the new invaders. This is the start of the monoGames Metaverse journey...
