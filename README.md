Welcome To Destiny Of The Universe Prologue, here we look at the history of the Universe in Alpha Version before we head to the future where battle lines are created, alliances are formed and we start to expand the game into the 12 Constellations Of The Universe and beyond.

Alpha Version (History)

4 Billion years ago the Galactic Alliance consisted of 12 different races which included Humans. 
Human Civilization originated from a planetary Constellation called Lira. Lira was at the center of the Universe. It Championed the Galactic Alliance and helped keep the peace with the power and wisdom of the ancient star knowledge which was given to them by the first ones (Hypertel). Lira had a Champion Council primarily made up of 12 Elites with a leader called Ka’ree. Each Elite has a unique ability and were the leaders of their clan, they include;

<ul>    
  <li>Ka'ree (Leader of the Hypertel Clan, The Elites and The Galactic Alliance)</li>
  <p></p>
  <ul><li>Cyiam (Leader of the Invisibility Clan)</li>
  <li>FTTankii (Leader of the Flying Clan)</li>
  <li>Harrii (Leader of the Psychic Clan)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
  <p></p>
<ul>    
  <li>Burstonia (Leader of the Resurrection Clan and Right hand Leader of the Elites)</li>
  <p></p>
  <ul><li>Riccoo (Leader of the Sound Clan)</li>
  <li>Brabantyan Leader of the Spectrum Clan)</li>
  <li>JohnniiFM (Leader of the Heal Clan)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
  <p></p>
<ul>    
  <li>JJsoo (Leader of the Pyro Clan and Left hand Leader of the Elites)</li>
  <p></p>
  <ul><li>Oha-The-Great (Leader of the Magic Clan)</li>
  <li>Blankii (Leader of the Archer Clan)</li>
  <li>Nixopps (Leader of the Melee Clan)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
    
To keep the peace every Galactic Precession the 12 Major Factions Of The Universe would come together for the Alliance Tournament in the Super Hyperspace Arena to meet and compete for the Star Trophy. The Star Trophy gives the winning race the Leadership Of The Universe. The importance of the games would allow Factions to show their skill sets and attributes that made that species great in friendly competition with the goal of strengthening ties among the races. 

This led to a great renaissance where the Universe flourished and enjoyed a great period of growth and prosperity. Little had everyone known that there was a stirring among the more darker parts of the Galactic Alliance. The Drako, the leader of this shadowy group, grew resentful of the other races because they never won the Star Trophy and were never seen as a major player in the Galactic Alliance due to always finishing last in the Alliance Tournaments. 
They are a race that wants power and will do anything to grab it as that is how they became the leader of the shadowy group. They also delve in Genetic Technology and were known to be a very resourceful race.

As it seems the stars would align for The Drako as during a meeting with the Earth Alliance, they overheard Burstonia of the Elites talking about his disgruntlement with the leadership of Ka’ree and wanted to be the leader himself. The Drako took no time in assembling a secret meeting with Burstonia to discuss a plan to make him the leader of the Human Race but in return The Drako wanted to know all their weaknesses, even Ka’ree’s. Burstonia agreed to the Drako terms so at the next Galactic Alliance Tournament they plotted to take out Ka’ree and wipe the other Elites. 

Finally the day had come for the Galactic Alliance Tournament in the Super Hyperspace Arena and unbeknownst to everyone what the Drako, Burstonia and the shadowy group were about to do with their allies in the Galactic Council - War had struck swiftly and chaos sprung and as agreed the Drako took out Ka'ree and the Elite Council with the knowledge of their weaknesses from Burstonia but they didn’t stop there they then used their mind manipulation abilities to turn the humans on themselves and nearly wiped them all out. Burstonia yelled out “What are you doing”? But it was too late as he quickly realized that all his friends were dying around him. Once the Humans were nearly wiped out, the Drako and their allies focused their attention on the other Galactic Member States and many of the other races were nearly wiped out instantly too.

But some humans escaped to the far reaches of the Universe and one of those places was a planet called Earth. An eon would pass and these stories would be told and before long they would become myths and legends. The humans would almost forget who they once were but they would go onto colonize this planetary system. It wouldn't be long before war broke out among themselves as they would fight over land, resources and betrayal but a bigger war was coming where a truce would nee to be implemented to survive the new invaders. This is the start of the monoGames Metaverse journey...

There are 12 <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Factions</a> altogether that will have teams in Destiny Of The Universe. Factions will be split into the Eclipse Alliance (Signum, Pirate Chain, Dragonchain and Koinos), Moon Alliance (Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and DOGE) and Sun Alliance (Hive, Wax, BSC and Zill) and will all Factions eventually be split into the 12 Constellations Of The Universe subject to the story line of Destiny Of The Universe.
